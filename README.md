# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was adapted from Jonas Schemdtmann's mapty app.

It has been re-developed using reactJS and redux.

## APIs/Modules

leaflet - for map
Browser localStorage - for local storage and persisting data

### Usage

Accept the request to use your location, and then click anywhere on the rendered map to insert a marker which indicates where a workout was performed

### TODO

I plan on adding a feature where user can draw on the map to indicate workout path

I plan to add a button to delete all persistent data in localstorage.

### ATTENTION

App uses localStorage Browser API. Go to dev tools > application tab > localHost > and then clear data.
